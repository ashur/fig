# ![Quickly build and deploy configuration profiles.](http://pug.sh.s3.amazonaws.com/fig.png)

## The Pitch

Maybe you test Mac apps and have different profiles for different user scenarios:

* New user
* Upgrading user
* Specific bug

or maybe you just like to keep your work and personal configurations separate.

If so, you know manually switching between application profiles on macOS is kind of a pain: digging around in `~/Library/Preferences` and `~/Library/Application Support` is messy work. Fig makes creating, managing and — most importantly — deploying these profiles a breeze.


## Get Started

Head on over to the [Fig Cookbook](https://github.com/ashur/fig/wiki) for everything you need to get up and running.


## This sounds a lot like...

...[Ansible](http://ansible.com)? It sure does! In fact, Fig borrows heavily from their syntax.

If you already use Ansible and you're comfortable with the ins-and-outs, you could (and probably should?) use that instead of Fig to manage your app profile configurations.
